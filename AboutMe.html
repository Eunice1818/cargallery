                <p>Hello, <br>
                    Welcome to my personal car gallery.</p> <br> <br>
                 <p>I made this gallery because i feel like nowadays, the car enthusiast is a dying breed.
                    The love of engines, speed, noise, and so much more has given way to (mostly) silent,
                    unexciting cars that the majority of the population only sees as means of transportation for getting
                    from point A to point B. Young folks like myself, are particularly uninterested. I can count on one hand
                    the amount of auto-enthused youth I've met since coming to college. But is all hope for us really lost?
                    Are we going to go extinct with the onset of soulless, boring, self-driving cars taking over
                    the roads, while our high-octane infused blood runs dry? I certainly think not. </p> <br> <br>
                 <p>So if you are someone like me, then visit my gallery where I have pictures of my favourite cars. Feel free
                    to put like or dislike on my pictures and also if you want you can add new pictures or even remove
                    some of them if you find them unattractive.</p>
